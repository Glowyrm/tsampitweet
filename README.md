# Project Overview

This project aims to be a proof of concept of the Tsampi API by implementing a client based around it. The client is written using the React and Redux frameworks, and aims to be a twitter clone, and quite possibly an internet celebrity (once its Instagram pops off... flex'n!)

## Architecture
### Routing
* Based on the ideas put forth by Tyler Thompson in his 2016 article, _"Let the URL Do the Talking, Part 1: The Pain of React Router in Redux"_
